"""Logging configuration for the Friday ADK agent.

Apply once at startup via :func:`configure_logging`.

Usage
-----
::

    from ang2react.components.logging import configure_logging
    configure_logging()          # reads LOG_LEVEL from env (default: INFO)

Or supply pre-built settings::

    from ang2react.components.logging import configure_logging, load_logging_settings
    settings = load_logging_settings()
    configure_logging(settings)

Integration with ``adk web``
-----------------------------
``adk web --log_level DEBUG`` configures the root logger before agent modules
are imported.  When ``LOG_LEVEL`` is **not** set in the environment,
:func:`configure_logging` detects existing handlers and defers to whatever the
ADK CLI already configured.  Set ``LOG_LEVEL`` explicitly to override the CLI
flag (e.g. ``LOG_LEVEL=WARNING`` in production).
